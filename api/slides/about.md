# Overview

Scala is a language that compiles to JVM bytecode.  It was designed to be safer, more powerful, and less verbose than Java.  
It features:

+ Full FP and OO paradigm support
+ A richer type system than Java and C#
+ Immutable values and data structures by default 
+ Far less boilerplate and redundancy
+ Pattern matching
+ Implicit classes and arguments to reduce verbosity and enhance expressiveness
+ Lots of other goodies:
    + OO on steroids - mixins, fined grained access control.
    + Typical modern language features - stuff that Java doesn't have like string interpolation, 
      default argument values, nested functions.
    + Macros
